# Predictive Text on the Lord of the Rings (Fellowship)
## Using Tensorflow / Keras
Generating a predictive text model, applied to the text of
_The Lord of The Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring_.  

This model is based from [Coursera's: Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow/) course by deeplearning.ai,
with thanks to Laurence Moroney and Andrew Ng for instructing.

The file structure is:
- [lotr_0_text_extract.ipynb](./lotr_0_text_extract.ipynb) - Extract / Tokenize / Prepare the data.
- [lotr_1_train_model.ipynb](./lotr_1_train_model.ipynb) - Build and Train the model
- [lotr_2_predict_text.ipynb](./lotr_2_predict_text.ipynb) - Use the model 
   to predict new text, and generate a new _Fellowship_ chapter.
